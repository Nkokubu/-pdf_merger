# -pdf_merger
This Python script allows users to merge multiple PDF files into a single document. The user is prompted to enter the full path to each PDF file. Once all files are entered, the script merges them in the given order and saves the result as merged_output.pdf. It uses the PyPDF2 library to handle PDF merging and performs basic input validation.
